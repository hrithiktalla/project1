        <h3>Paleolithic era:</h3>
        <img src="ancientimage.jpg">
        <p> 
            According to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson:
            
            Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially they came by way of the coast. ... it is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present.[26]</p><p>
            
            According to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin:
            
            Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonization of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka.[27]</p><p>
            
            Historian of South Asia, Michael H. Fisher, states:
            
            Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago.[28]</p>
            <h3>Neolithic era:</h3>
            <img src="nepthalic.jpg">
            <p>Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River alluvium approximately 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[2][33] According to Tim Dyson: "By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley." Michael Fisher adds:[34]</p>

            <h3>Bronze Age (c. 3300 – c. 1800 BCE):</h3>
            <img src="bronze.jpg">
            <p>The Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300 BCE.[citation needed] The Indus Valley region was one of three early cradles of civilization in the Old World; the Indus Valley civilisation was the most expansive,[35] and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million.[36]</p>
            <p>The civilisation was primarily centered in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in the Ghaggar-Hakra River basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as Harappa, Ganweriwal, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in modern-day India.</p>
            <h3>Iron Age (c. 1800 – 200 BCE):</h3>
            <img src="ironage.jpg">
            <p>tarting ca. 1900 BCE, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration.[43][44] The Vedic period is the period when the Vedas were composed, the liturgical hymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period.[45]</p>
            <h3>Classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 650 CE):</h3>
            <img src="classicalperiod.jpg">
            <img src="classicalperiod2.jpeg">
            <p>The time between the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE and the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE is referred to as the "Classical" period of India.[120] The Gupta Empire (4th–6th century) is regarded as the "Golden Age" of Hinduism, although a host of kingdoms ruled over India in these centuries. Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India.[121] During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.[122][123]</p>
